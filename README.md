# song-a-day
A pretty bad attempt of a bot for Discord Hack Week, made by two people who are pretty new to python. The two said people are me, (jpadd59#6337) and lim#1908.

Just the code. If you want to host it yourself or use a hosting website, go ahead. 

To add songs use the template below:

('```Artist; [Artist]                                                                                                 '

'Song; [Song]                                                                                                                '

'Album; [Album]                                                                                                      '
          
'Genre; [Genre]                                                                                                       '

'Link;``` [URL])'),
